This includes anything from simple rule based programs, to advanced deep learning algorithms. It is worth noting that AI is an umbrella term that encompasses several sub-fields today, each of these sub-fields will likely receive their own entry in this dictionary.

### What do we use it for?

AI is used for several tasks today, in fact it is becoming difficult to find an industry that currently does not use AI. A few examples of applications of AI in our everyday life are virtual assistants, large language models, GPS guidance systems and autonomous vehicles.

### How does it work?

AI works in several different ways, there are many different technologies that could be considered to be AI. Thus we will not discuss how it works here, as there will be entries created for all of these different types of technologies.

If we were to discuss how AI works, this text would likely become the length of several textbooks combined.
