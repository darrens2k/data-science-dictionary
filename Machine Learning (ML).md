# Machine Learning (ML)

### What is it?

According to IBM, Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

### What do we use it for?

We use machine learning for several different applications, there are far too many to list here, but some include: predictive modelling, forecasting and classification.

### How does it work?

There are several different types of machine learning models, most of which (if not all) will receive their own entries in this dictionary at some point in time. But the general process of machine learning (as outlined by IBM) will be discussed here.

1. A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.

2. An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.

3. A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.
