# data-science-dictionary

This is a repository to store a dictionary of various terms I have come across on my data science journey.

I've recently begun searching for the first full time job of my data science career, and as such have gone through several interviews at various companies. Throughout this process I have been reminded of the amount of terms and concepts that individuals within the data science space must be familiar with. As such, I have decided to create a repository to store a dictionary of these concepts to help both myself and others.

Each entry in this dictionary will aim to provide a brief explanation about a concept (in case someone needs to learn about it quickly), and a more in-depth explanation for the more curious.

As I create more entries (moving forward I will aim to create at least one new entry per week) I will begin to organize certain concepts into folders. If this is something you would like to be a part of, please reach out to me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrens7/).
