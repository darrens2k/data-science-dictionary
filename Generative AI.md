### What is it?

Generative AI is a type of AI that can be used to create (or generate) new content. This content could be in form of text, images, videos or other types of media.

### What do we use it for?

Generative AI has many applications in today's world. Large Language Models are a form of generative AI, OpenAI's GPT-4 is an example of large language model. Image generation models, such as DALLE, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, are also applications of generative AI.

### How does it work?

In the future, the different applications of generative AI discussed above will likely receive their own separate entries in the Data Science Dictionary. Thus, this will be a high level description, and the future entries of each specific applications will delve into the specifics of how they function.

Generative AI models operate on large databases of the type of media they intend to replicate to learn its patterns. Once the patterns of existing media are learnt from the data, the models can then generate new media based on the learnt patterns.

Some models can learn how to encode features of the existing media into a sort of latent space, and then can generate new media by sampling this latent space. While other models simply aim to replicate the probability distributions that were learnt from the existing media.
